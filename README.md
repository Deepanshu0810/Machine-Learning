# Machine Learning
<p>This repository contains beginner level projects based on different machine learning algorithms</p>

### House Predictions
> This is house prediction model which uses linear regression. This model finds a linear relationship between the<br>independent and the target variable.
Then this model predicts the values from that relation.

### Titanic
> This is survival prediction model which uses logistic regression. This model uses sigmoid probability to predict<br>either 0 or 1.

### Big Mart
> This is sales prediction model which uses linear regression. This project also includes exploratory data analysis and data cleaning.

### Radio Voice
> In this project we classified the voices of males and females based on the frequencies and other features using Support vector Classifier.<br>
We used the GridSearchCV to optimize the model, it uses hyperparameter tuning to determine the optimal values of a model.
